<h1>User Documentation</h1>

<strong>Intro</strong>: The initial page contains a map of Crested Butte Mountain Resort. A toggle is placed above and on the right side of the map. This toggle switches between view mode, which is the default, and add mode. 

<strong>Viewing Location</strong>: While on view mode, you can click pins on the map. Each pin represents a location on the mountain where photos have been uploaded or will be uploaded depicting that location. When a pin is clicked, if photos have been uploaded to that point, you will be taken to a slideshow of the corresponding photos. If photos have not yet been uploaded, you will be taken to an upload page where you can add photos to that location.

<strong>Adding Location</strong>: While on add mode, you can click on an area of the map that is not occupied by another pin to add a pin of where you would like photos to be uploaded to. You can also click on an existing pin to add photos to an already existing pin. This will take you to an upload page where you can browse your computer and upload your image.
